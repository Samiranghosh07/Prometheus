❓ 1. Do you need to install Node Exporter on every machine for Prometheus to monitor them?
✅ Yes, if you want Prometheus to monitor system-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) for that machine, you need to install Node Exporter on each machine (node) that you want to monitor.

Node Exporter exposes machine metrics at an HTTP endpoint (default: :9100).

Prometheus scrapes these endpoints to collect the data.

❓ 2. Do you need to install Node Exporter on the Prometheus server itself?
➡️ Only if you want to monitor the Prometheus server’s own system metrics.

It's not required for Prometheus to function.

But if you're treating the Prometheus server like any other node (monitoring its CPU, memory, etc.), then yes, install Node Exporter there too.
